# US Visa Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project explores the US Visa dataset from Kaggle, where I performed feature engineering and trained multiple machine learning models to determine the best-performing model for visa classification.


# Dataset

Source: Kaggle - US Visa Dataset
The dataset contains information about visa applicants, including their employment details, employer, case status, wage, and other factors.


# Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.

Encoded categorical features using techniques like One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding.

Performed feature selection to improve model performance.

Applied Power Transformation.

#  Models Trained

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)

KNN
